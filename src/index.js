          title="Ragdoll Cat Colors and Patterns"
          content="Ragdoll cat colors and patterns come in a wide variety. Each one is gorgeous and elegant in its own right. For example, the Ragdoll pictured below, Dandenong Tora Rhianne, is a Seal Mitted with a blaze. The blaze is the white stripe that goes down the center of the nose. The Ragdoll cat has a soft semi-long coat that does not require as regular a grooming as many other long-haired breeds. Ragdolls are born white (unless they are mink cats), and Ragdoll cat colors and patterns come in slowly."

          content="My mom’s Ragdoll cats, Caymus and Murphy, peed almost standing up, or as they peed, they’d lift their bottoms. In contrast, my 12-year-old Ragdoll cats, Charlie and Trigg, stay in a squatting position the entire time they are peeing.
          My mom had to get high-sided litterboxes because of Caymus and Murphy. Here’s a cat on Instagram that has a similar problem.      
          When I discovered high-sided litter boxes also helped keep the litter inside the box, that was another reason I wanted some."
